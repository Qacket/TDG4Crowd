Paperï¼šTest Data Generation for Evaluation of Aggregation Algorithms in Crowdsourcin

The labelme folder is a corresponding experiment conducted on the Labelme dataset.
Labelme is an image dataset. We obtain feature vectors through image preprocessing and use them as input to the model.
Domin_Relation folder has conducted corresponding experiments on the relationship dataset.
Relation is a text dataset. We preprocess sentences to obtain feature vectors as input to the model.

Overall, the experimental steps generally include multiple steps such as data preprocessing, partitioning, model training, data generation, aggregation, calculation of evaluation indicators, drawing, etc
